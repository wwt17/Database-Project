# Database Project

## Prepare

Download data from [this kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease). Unzip the downloaded `heart-disease.zip` to obtain `heart_2020_cleaned.csv`. Rename `heart_2020_cleaned.csv` to `data.csv` under this folder.

Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

To start the client:
```
python main.py
```
Then you can interact with the program in CLI.

Run
```
python main.py -h
```
for the usage of commmand line options.
